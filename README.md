# My Personal Project

## What will the application do?
My application will essentially be an **epidemic spread simulation**. 
There will be an interface where users can insert the conditions for a disease 
such as the infection rate, fatality rate, number of people in population, etc.
Additionally, I will be adding special features that can be turned on/off by the
user such as population growth, recovery rates, etc. Then, once the user has 
determined the conditions for the disease, they can view the simulation through
an interface which showcases the population and their current condition (normal,
sick, dead). After a specified period of time or after manually stopping the simulation
from running, the user can look at the graphs generated by the simulation after. Some 
examples include:
- Infection Rates vs Time 
- Fatality Rates vs Time
- Recovery Rates vs Time

Users can also receive statistical analysis of each of the graphs such as 
providing a simple linear regression analysis, descriptive statistics, and even
inferential statistics using certain methods. 

## Who will use it? 
My application can be used in various situations. From a high school student
to a data analyst specialist, there is a limitless amount of uses for this application.
From one perspective, my application can be used as a "for fun" model where users can play
around and test out different combinations of conditions and look at the statistical
outcomes of each event. From another perspective, this application can be used on a more
macro level where government health agencies, educational institutions, and even data analysts
can use this application. From providing simulations that encompass various factors and 
allows researchers or doctors in testing different intervention method to having this tool
used as an educational tool for providing hands-on experience in modeling and analyzing 
epidemic situation. At the end of the day, **Anyone could use it.**

## Why is the project of interest to you?
This project is very interesting to me as I have always been really into data science 
statistics. Analyzing data has always been incredibly intuitive to me and this project
that allows me the actually simulate the data that I need to analyze brings my interest
even higher. I already have a strong idea of how I want to implement it which makes
the project all that more feasible to create.Additionally, I think that this would be incredible project to put on my
personal portfolio as it demonstrates many skills such as statistical analysis, 
data visualization, and it would ultimately be a great showcase for my knowledge of 
Java. 

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a person to the population
- As a user, I want to be able to view the simulation in real time
- As a user, I want to be able to view the statistical information at the end of the simulation
- As a user, I want to be able to turn on/off multiple variable conditions
- As a user, when I'm simulating the simulation, I want to be able to save my simulation
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load
any previous simulations from file
