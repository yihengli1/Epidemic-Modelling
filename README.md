# Epidemic Simulation 

## What will the application do?
My application will essentially be an **epidemic spread simulation**. 
There will be an interface where users can insert the conditions for a disease 
such as the infection rate, fatality rate, number of people in population, etc.
Additionally, I will be adding special features that can be turned on/off by the
user such as population growth, recovery rates, etc. Then, once the user has 
determined the conditions for the disease, they can view the simulation through
an interface which showcases the population and their current condition (normal,
sick, dead). 

## Who will use it? 
My application can be used in various situations. From a high school student
to a data analyst specialist, there is a limitless amount of uses for this application.
From one perspective, my application can be used as a "for fun" model where users can play
around and test out different combinations of conditions and look at the statistical
outcomes of each event. From another perspective, this application can be used on a more
macro level where government health agencies, educational institutions, and even data analysts
can use this application. From providing simulations that encompass various factors and 
allows researchers or doctors in testing different intervention method to having this tool
used as an educational tool for providing hands-on experience in modeling and analyzing 
epidemic situation. At the end of the day, **Anyone could use it.**
