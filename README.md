# 🦠 Epidemic Simulation
Welcome to the Epidemic Simulation App—a dynamic tool designed to model the spread of diseases based on real-world conditions. 

# 🚀 What Does It Do?
This application simulates the spread of an epidemic based on customizable conditions. You can adjust key variables like:

Infection Rate
Fatality Rate
Population Size
Recovery Rate (optional toggle)
Population Growth (optional toggle)
Once you’ve set the conditions, the simulation visually displays the population’s status—showing who’s healthy, infected, or deceased. It’s an interactive, data-driven way to see how diseases can spread under different circumstances.

# 🌍 Who Is It For?
The Epidemic Simulation App is designed for everyone:

Students learning about epidemiology and data modeling
Educators looking for interactive tools to teach complex concepts
Data Analysts & Researchers testing outbreak scenarios and intervention strategies
Curious Minds who enjoy experimenting with different variables to see how small changes can create big outcomes

# 💡 Why Use This App?
Simple, user-friendly interface
Customizable parameters for detailed simulations
Toggle advanced features like recovery rates and population growth
Great for both casual experimentation and serious analysis
